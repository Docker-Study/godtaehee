# WEEK 1

## Why we use docker?

- We can install any program easily using docker

### Installing Redis without using a docker

```shell
wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.5.tar.gz
tar xzf redis-6.0.5.tar.gz
cd redis-6.0.5
make
```

Is it going well? If it goes well, do what you've been doing.

If `wget` is not installed in your device, we must install `wget` command

Before we install any application, we must pre-install other thing

That's why we use docker

If we use docker, we don't need to pre-install other thing no more

### Installing Redis using a docker

```shell
docker run -it redis
```

You can simply download above command.

Of course, you can download Redis without using a docker.

But, using a docker, Redis can be installed more easily.

## What is a docker?

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 


## The Docker Dashboard

Docker Dashboard gives you a quick view of  the containers running on your machine.

It gives you quick access to container logs, lets you get a shell inside the container, and lets you easily manage container lifecycle(stop, remove, etc..)

## What is a container?

A container is a sandboxed process on your machine that is isolated from all other processes on the host machine.

That isolation leverages [kernel namespaces and croups](https://medium.com/@saschagrunert/demystifying-containers-part-i-kernel-space-2c53d6979504), feature that have been in Linux for a long time. Docker has worked to make these capabilities approachable and easy to use.

## What is a container image?

When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a container image. Since the image contains the containerâ€™s filesystem, it must contain everything needed to run an application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.
